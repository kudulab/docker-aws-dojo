# docker-aws-dojo

[Dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo) docker image with:
   * [awscli](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli)
   * [boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3)
   * make
   * [saml2aws](https://github.com/Versent/saml2aws)
   * [aws-nuke](https://github.com/rebuy-de/aws-nuke)
   * ecs-cli

Based on alpine docker image.

## Usage

1. Install [Dojo](https://github.com/kudulab/dojo/#installation)
2. Provide a Dojofile:
```
$ cat Dojofile
DOJO_DOCKER_IMAGE="kudulab/aws-dojo:0.7.0"
```
3. Enter a docker container by running `dojo` in the same directory as Dojofile.
4. Example commands to run inside the Dojo created container:
```
aws --version
aws ec2 describe-instances --filters "Name=tag:Name,Values=ec2-ansible-test"
```

## Configuration
If the directory `$HOME/.aws` exists locally, then it will be read-only mounted into a Dojo Docker container. This is how we can provide AWS credentials to the Dojo Docker container.

## Contributing
Instructions how to update this project.

1. Create a new feature branch from the main branch: master
2. Work on your changes in that feature branch. If you want, describe you changes in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)
3. Build your image locally to check that it succeeds: `./tasks build_local`
4. Install the test framework by either running the commands from [here](https://github.com/kudulab/docker-terraform-dojo/blob/1.8.0/tasks#L66) or follow these steps:
  * Install [bats](https://bats-core.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html)
   for running tests.
  * Checkout the repositories
   [bats-core/bats-support](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-support) and
   [bats-core/bats-assert](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-assert) into your
   system's `/opt` directory, to satisfy testing dependencies.
5. Test your image locally: `./tasks itest`
6. If you are happy with the results, create a PR from your feature branch to master branch

After this, someone will read your PR, merge it and ensure version bump (using `./tasks set_version`). CI pipeline will run to automatically build and test docker image, release the project and publish the docker image.
